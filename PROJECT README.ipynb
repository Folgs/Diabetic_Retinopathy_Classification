Objectives\n","\n","The main goal of this project was to understand and work with clinical images to tackle real-life problems. We wanted to try different approaches to see which want better solves the problem.

Experiment setup\n","\n","Instead of the one-hot encoding that we use as in the previous networks, now we will use one that helps to understand the ordering nature.

However, the results using both methods are really similar.\n","\n","The code has been adapted to introduce this change and do the translations:\n","\n","\n","*   The model has also been changed, since now we have to finish it with a *Sigmoid* function, so that all elements in the vector are between 0 and 1.\n","*   The usual loss function is not valid anymore, and we have had to adapt it. We have used weights as before to tackle the umbalanced dataset. \n","*   For the accuracy and other measures we have to translate the labels as a vector of dimension 5 as before, or the reverse translation, from a vector of dimension 5 to its one-dimension label.\n","\n","We have used the *MSELoss* because it showed slightly better results in this case than the *CrossEntropyLoss*. \n","\n","After different setups, we found that the best one for us was the simplest one with a low learning rate, as in the classification problem. Adding more layers or complexificating them led to a lot more training time and not so better results. We have used a pretrained Resnet50, although we think that similar results could be found with a less complex Resnet. \n","\n","### 4.3.3. Results\n","\n","The following images correspond to a run with learning rate <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1.e-5\"> and Resnet50:\n","\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","  <img width=\"40%\" src= \"Readme_Images/run_order_Loss.svg\" /> \n","  <img width=\"40%\" src= \"Readme_Images/run_order_Accuracy.svg\" /> \n","</p>\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","  <img width=\"40%\" src= \"Readme_Images/run_order_Kappa.svg\" /> \n","  <img width=\"40%\" src= \"Readme_Images/run_order_confMat.png\" /> \n","</p>\n","\n","This approach did not produce the desired effect.

Image and metadata Network\n","\n","### 4.4.1. Objectives\n","Our dataset not only had images, but also metadata that explained the gravity of the diabetes. A more advanced diabetes could lead more easily to a high level of retinopathy, so we introduced them to our model. We want to see if this increases the performance of our previous network, as well as which importance does it give to the metadata in comparison with the image.\n","\n","### 4.4.2. Experiment setup\n","\n","We used a pretrained Resnet34 model for the images and concatenate the result of it with a model with the metadata and the final layer. \n","\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","  <img width=\"80%\" src= \"Readme_Images/Image_Metadata.png\" />\n","</p>\n","\n","However, this showed to be too computational expensive and we opt for a more simple network: The Resnet34 network concatenated with the metadata and a final layer.

We used a low learning rate of <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1.e-6\">.\n","\n","Finally, we did another experiment. We had our best image classification model and concatenate it with the data (concatenating the 5-layer final output with the 8-layer input metadata).\n","\n","As explained before, there are different ways to input the NaNs in the metadata.

Also, we observe (in this run and in all runs done) that the confusion matrix is a lower triangular matrix. Understanding this output maybe could help us.\n","\n","As a surprise, it started much better than using the best output of our classification model as initial input. This could be because of the chosen architectures for each type:\n","\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","  <img width=\"40%\" src= \"Readme_Images/run_comb_pret_loss.svg\" /> \n","  <img width=\"40%\" src= \"Readme_Images/run_comb_pret_accuracy.svg\" /> \n","</p>\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","  <img width=\"40%\" src= \"Readme_Images/run_comb_pret_kappa.svg\" /> \n","  <img width=\"40%\" src= \"Readme_Images/run_comb_pret_confMat.png\" /> \n","</p>\n","\n","## 4.5.
